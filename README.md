# CS50-s-Introduction-to-Artificial-Intelligence-with-Python

Here are codes from CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course. Also there are handwritten notes. In the future I will create some sort of tree 
that will represent categories of algorithms that are mentioned through the course.


Down there is mindmap representation of tearms through the lectures. There are not all but you can get overall idea of terms that are mentioned through the course, I have combined terms from search lecture into knowleadge.
